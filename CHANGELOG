* Added namespace lookup to optionals and expectations. For example, in ActiveRecord
  several matchers have :allow_nil and :allow_blank as options. So you can store
  the translation at:

    remarkable:
      activerecord:
        optionals:
          allow_nil:
            # ...
          allow_blank:
            # ...

* Added a repository to hold I18n files

# v3.0

* Added Remarkable::Matchers. Now you can include your Remarkable matchers and
  macros in test unit as well.

    class Test::Unit::TestCase
      include Spec::Matchers
      include Remarkable::Matchers
      extend  Remarkable::Macros
    end

* Added pending and disabled macros
* Added I18n
* Added DSL core structure
* Added macros core structure
* Added matchers core structure
